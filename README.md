# Weathershare




https://weathershare.my.canva.site/
Weathershare is a crowdsourcing application that collects weather reports from many people to help verify weather forecasts. This application encourages the community to share weather conditions in their surrounding environment.

## Why bothers develop this app?

- Most weather forecast is accurate, but the real condition might be differ on each location
- Radar and satellite images are limited and cannot capture real condition on the ground within small scale
- The limited number of weather stations makes weather forecast verification slow

## Benefits
- Crowdsourcing can significantly increase the number of data points available for weather prediction
- Crowdsourcing weather data encourages community participation and engagement
- Crowdsourced data can offer real-time information on weather conditions,
